# PaleoMagnetics Format Converters

A collection of Python scripts designed to convert between various paleomagnetic data formats (2G .dat, Remasoft .rs3, Utrecht .th, Thellier-tool .tdt, .asc).

These scripts have been developed for the conversion of paleomagnetic files, primarily those used in the Paleomagnetism Laboratory at the University of Burgos (Spain).

The operation of all scripts is similar. The simplest way to use them is to place the script in a folder containing the files to be converted and then run the program to perform the conversion.

### 2G_2_asci_v2024.py
Converts 2G *.dat files to *.asc files, similar to the original 2G program.

### 2G_2_rs3_v2024.py
Converts 2G .dat files to text files.

### 2G_2_Utrecht_v2024.py
Converts 2G .dat files to *.th format (Utrecht).

### RS3_2_TDT_v2024.py
Converts Remasoft *.rs3 files to TDT format.
